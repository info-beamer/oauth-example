# info-beamer OAuth2 integration example

This example shows a basic [OAuth2 based app](https://info-beamer.com/doc/oauth)
integrating into the [info-beamer hosted digital signage platform](https://info-beamer.com).

Apps request access to user accounts and once granted they can issue API calls
on behalf of the user. This allows a very deep integration into the info-beamer
platform.
